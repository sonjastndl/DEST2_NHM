# Analysis of Inversion Specific Markers in the DESTv2 dataset.

The included scripts were applied to the *PoolSNP* and *SNAPE* VCF files of the DESTv2 project, the filtered markers correspond with *inversion_markers_v6.txt*.
Average fequencies of these inversion specific marker SNPs were determined for each SNP calling method.
The Following Analyses were performed:

### Method Correlation
Correlation of average frequencies for both methods were investigated for correlation. 

### Latitudinal Clines Across Continents 
For inverions *In.3R.Payne*, *In.2L.t*, *In.2R.Ns*, *In.3R.C*, *In.3R.K*, *In.3R.Mo* and  *In.3L.P* several analysis of relationship between latitude and inversion frequencies were performed. 

### Consistency Across Years
Investigations were performed on North American sampels and European samples, to get insight into consistency of allele frequencies across years.  

## Pipeline Steps
